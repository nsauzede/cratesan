# CrateSan
A tribute to [Sokoban](https://sokoban.jp/) by Thinking Rabbit,
made in Rust and V languages, using SDL2 for multimedia.

# Try it
## With Rust
```
$ cargo run
```

## With V
```
$ v run src/cratesan.v
```

# Build prerequisites

## Rust
### Linux
You only need to install standard SDL2 dev packages (search for that elsewhere on the web).

### Windows
Follow [the rust-sdl2 instructions](https://github.com/Rust-SDL2/rust-sdl2).
At the end, you should have the folders "gnu-mingw" and "msvc" alongside this README.md,
in order to build on Windows.

# Controls
- Arrows to move the player
- "u" to undo last move
- "s" to save snapshot
- "l" to load snapshot
- "r" to restart level
- Return to proceed to next level, when current is won
